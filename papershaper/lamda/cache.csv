      x – y + z = 2
      2x + y – z = 1

17.  Determine whether the following system of equations is consistent or inconsistent:
      x + 2y = 3
      2x + 4y = 6

18. Find the area of the triangle formed by the points (a, b+c), (b, c+a), and (c, a+b) using determinants.  What can you conclude about the points?

19. A fruit seller sells apples, bananas, and oranges. The cost of 2 apples, 3 bananas, and 4 oranges is $10. The cost of 3 apples, 2 bananas, and 1 orange is $7. The cost of 1 apple, 1 banana, and 1 orange is $3.  Find the cost of each fruit using matrix methods.


This sample paper covers a broader range of concepts and difficulty levels compared to the provided text, testing the student's understanding of determinants and their applications.  Remember to adjust the difficulty and marking scheme to suit your specific curriculum.
