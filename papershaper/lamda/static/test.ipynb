       "\"9\\nCHAPTER\\nLight – Reflection and\\nRefraction\\nWe see a variety of objects in the world around us. However, we are\\nunable to see anything in a dark room. On lighting up the room,\\nthings become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the\\nsunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.\\nThis reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.\\nWe are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted\\nthrough it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena\\nassociated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling\\nof stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium\\nand so on. A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.\\nBy observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may\\nconclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small\\nsource of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this\\nstraight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.\\n134 Science\\n!wonK\\not\\neroM\\nIf an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small, light has a tendency to\\nbend around it and not walk in a straight line – an effect known as the diffraction of\\nlight. Then the straight-line treatment of optics using rays fails. To explain phenomena\\nsuch as diffraction, light is thought of as a wave, the details of which you will study\\nin higher classes. Again, at the beginning of the 20th century, it became known that\\nthe wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of\\nlight with matter, and light often behaves somewhat like a stream of particles. This\\nconfusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern\\nquantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a ‘wave’ nor a ‘particle’ –\\nthe new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature.\\nIn this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena of reflection and\\nrefraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic\\nconcepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in\\nnature. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of light\\nby spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real\\nlife situations.\\n99999.....11111 RRRRREEEEEFFFFFLLLLLEEEEECCCCCTTTTTIIIIIOOOOONNNNN OOOOOFFFFF LLLLLIIIIIGGGGGHHHHHTTTTT\\nA highly polished surface, such as a mirror, reflects most of the light\\nfalling on it. You are already familiar with the laws of reflection of light.\\n2024-25Let us recall these laws –\\n(i) The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and\\n(ii) The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence\\nand the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\\nThese laws of reflection are applicable to all types of reflecting surfaces\\nincluding spherical surfaces. You are familiar with the formation of image\\nby a plane mirror. What are the properties of the image? Image formed\\nby a plane mirror is always virtual and erect. The size of the image is\\nequal to that of the object. The image formed is as far behind the mirror\\nas the object is in front of it. Further, the image is laterally inverted.\\nHow would the images be when the reflecting surfaces are curved? Let\\nus explore.\\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 99999.....11111\\nn Take a large shining spoon. Try to view your face in its curved\\nsurface.\\nn Do you get the image? Is it smaller or larger?\\nn Move the spoon slowly away from your face. Observe the image.\\nHow does it change?\\nn Reverse the spoon and repeat the Activity. How does the image\\nlook like now?\\nn Compare the characteristics of the image on the two surfaces.\\nThe curved surface of a shining spoon could be considered as a curved\\nmirror. The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical\\nmirror. The reflecting surface of such mirrors can be considered to form\\na part of the surface of a sphere. Such mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces\\nare spherical, are called spherical mirrors. We shall now study about\\nspherical mirrors in some detail.\\n99999.....22222 SSSSSPPPPPHHHHHEEEEERRRRRIIIIICCCCCAAAAALLLLL MMMMMIIIIIRRRRRRRRRROOOOORRRRRSSSSS\\nThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or\\noutwards. A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards,\\nthat is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.\\nA spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called\\na convex mirror. The schematic representation of these mirrors is shown\\nin Fig. 9.1. You may note in these diagrams that the back\\nof the mirror is shaded.\\nYou may now understand that the surface of the spoon\\ncurved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror\\nand the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be\\napproximated to a convex mirror.\\nBefore we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to\\nrecognise and understand the meaning of a few terms. These\\nterms are commonly used in discussions about spherical (a) Concave mirror (b) Convex mirror\\nmirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....11111\\nmirror is a point called the pole. It lies on the surface of the Schematic representation of spherical\\nmirror. The pole is usually represented by the letter P. mirrors; the shaded side is non-reflecting.\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 135\\n2024-25The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere.\\nThis sphere has a centre. This point is called the centre of curvature of\\nthe spherical mirror. It is represented by the letter C. Please note that the\\ncentre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting\\nsurface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.\\nHowever, it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror. You may\\nnote this in Fig.9.2 (a) and (b). The radius of the sphere of which the\\nreflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius\\nof curvature of the mirror. It is represented by the letter R. You may note\\nthat the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. Imagine a straight\\nline passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical\\nmirror. This line is called the principal axis. Remember that principal\\naxis is normal to the mirror at its pole. Let us understand an important\\nterm related to mirrors, through an Activity.\\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 99999.....22222\\nCAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or even into a mirror\\nreflecting sunlight. It may damage your eyes.\\nn Hold a concave mirror in your hand and direct its reflecting surface\\ntowards the Sun.\\nn Direct the light reflected by the mirror on to a sheet of paper held\\nclose to the mirror.\\nn Move the sheet of paper back and forth gradually until you find\\non the paper sheet a bright, sharp spot of light.\\nn Hold the mirror and the paper in the same position for a few\\nminutes. What do you observe? Why?\\nThe paper at first begins to burn producing smoke. Eventually it\\nmay even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is converged\\nat a point, as a sharp, bright spot by the mirror. In fact, this spot of light\\nis the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper. This point is\\nthe focus of the concave mirror. The heat produced due to\\nthe concentration of sunlight ignites the paper. The distance\\nof this image from the position of the mirror gives the\\napproximate value of focal length of the mirror.\\nLet us try to understand this observation with the help\\nof a ray diagram.\\n(a)\\nObserve Fig.9.2 (a) closely. A number of rays parallel\\nto the principal axis are falling on a concave mirror. Observe\\nthe reflected rays. They are all meeting/intersecting at a\\npoint on the principal axis of the mirror. This point is called\\nthe principal focus of the concave mirror. Similarly, observe\\nFig. 9.2 (b). How are the rays parallel to the principal axis,\\nreflected by a convex mirror? The reflected rays appear to\\ncome from a point on the principal axis. This point is called\\n(b) the principal focus of the convex mirror. The principal focus\\nis represented by the letter F. The distance between the\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....22222\\npole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called\\n(a) Concave mirror\\n(b) Convex mirror the focal length. It is represented by the letter f.\\n136 Science\\n2024-25The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is by-and-large spherical.\\nThe surface, then, has a circular outline. The diameter of the reflecting\\nsurface of spherical mirror is called its aperture. In Fig.9.2, distance MN\\nrepresents the aperture. We shall consider in our discussion only such\\nspherical mirrors whose aperture is much smaller than its radius of\\ncurvature.\\nIs there a relationship between the radius of curvature R, and focal\\nlength f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures,\\nthe radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. We\\nput this as R = 2f . This implies that the principal focus of a spherical\\nmirror lies midway between the pole and centre of curvature.\\n9.2.1 Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors\\nYou have studied about the image formation by plane mirrors. You also\\nknow the nature, position and relative size of the images formed by them.\\nHow about the images formed by spherical mirrors? How can we locate\\nthe image formed by a concave mirror for different positions of the object?\\nAre the images real or virtual? Are they enlarged, diminished or have\\nthe same size? We shall explore this with an Activity.\\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 99999.....33333\\nYou have already learnt a way of determining the focal length of a\\nconcave mirror. In Activity 9.2, you have seen that the sharp bright\\nspot of light you got on the paper is, in fact, the image of the Sun. It\\nwas a tiny, real, inverted image. You got the approximate focal length\\nof the concave mirror by measuring the distance of the image from\\nthe mirror.\\nn Take a concave mirror. Find out its approximate focal length in\\nthe way described above. Note down the value of focal length. (You\\ncan also find it out by obtaining image of a distant object on a\\nsheet of paper.)\\nn Mark a line on a Table with a chalk. Place the concave mirror on\\na stand. Place the stand over the line such that its pole lies over\\nthe line.\\nn Draw with a chalk two more lines parallel to the previous line\\nsuch that the distance between any two successive lines is equal\\nto the focal length of the mirror. These lines will now correspond\\nto the positions of the points P, F and C, respectively. Remember –\\nFor a spherical mirror of small aperture, the principal focus F lies\\nmid-way between the pole P and the centre of curvature C.\\nn Keep a bright object, say a burning candle, at a position far beyond\\nC. Place a paper screen and move it in front of the mirror till you\\nobtain a sharp bright image of the candle flame on it.\\nn Observe the image carefully. Note down its nature, position and\\nrelative size with respect to the object size.\\nn Repeat the activity by placing the candle – (a) just beyond C,\\n(b) at C, (c) between F and C, (d) at F, and (e) between P and F.\\nn In one of the cases, you may not get the image on the screen.\\nIdentify the position of the object in such a case. Then, look for its\\nvirtual image in the mirror itself.\\nn Note down and tabulate your observations.\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 137\\n2024-25You will see in the above Activity that the nature, position and size of\\nthe image formed by a concave mirror depends on the position of the\\nobject in relation to points P, F and C. The image formed is real for some\\npositions of the object. It is found to be a virtual image for a certain other\\nposition. The image is either magnified, reduced or has the same size,\\ndepending on the position of the object. A summary of these observations\\nis given for your reference in Table 9.1.\\nTable 9.1 Image formation by a concave mirror for different positions of the object\\nPosition of the Position of the Size of the Nature of the\\nobject image image image\\nAt infinity At the focus F Highly diminished, Real and inverted\\npoint-sized\\nBeyond C Between F and C Diminished Real and inverted\\nAt C At C Same size Real and inverted\\nBetween C and F Beyond C Enlarged Real and inverted\\nAt F At infinity Highly enlarged Real and inverted\\nBetween P and F Behind the mirror Enlarged Virtual and erect\\n9.2.2 Representation of Images Formed by Spherical\\nMirrors Using Ray Diagrams\\nWe can also study the formation of images by spherical mirrors by\\ndrawing ray diagrams. Consider an extended object, of finite size, placed\\nin front of a spherical mirror. Each small portion of the extended object\\nacts like a point source. An infinite number of rays originate from each\\nof these points. To construct the ray diagrams, in order to locate the\\nimage of an object, an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating from a\\npoint could be considered. However, it is more convenient to consider\\nonly two rays, for the sake of clarity of the ray diagram. These rays are\\nso chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the\\nmirror.\\nThe intersection of at least two reflected rays give the position of image\\nof the point object. Any two of the following rays can be considered for\\nlocating the image.\\n(i) A ray parallel to the principal\\naxis, after reflection, will pass\\nthrough the principal focus\\nin case of a concave mirror\\nor appear to diverge from\\nthe principal focus in\\ncase of a convex mirror.\\nThis is illustrated in Fig.9.3\\n(a) (b)\\n(a) and (b).\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....33333\\n138 Science\\n2024-25(ii) A ray passing through the\\nprincipal focus of a concave\\nmirror or a ray which is\\ndirected towards the\\nprincipal focus of a convex\\nmirror, after reflection, will\\nemerge parallel to the\\nprincipal axis. This is\\nillustrated in Fig.9.4 (a)\\nand (b). (a) (b)\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....44444\\n(iii) A ray passing through the\\ncentre of curvature of a\\nconcave mirror or directed\\nin the direction of the centre\\nof curvature of a convex\\nmirror, after reflection, is\\nreflected back along the\\nsame path. This is\\nillustrated in Fig.9.5 (a) and\\n(b). The light rays come back\\n(a) (b)\\nalong the same path\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....55555\\nbecause the incident rays\\nfall on the mirror along the\\nnormal to the reflecting\\nsurface.\\n(iv) A ray incident obliquely to\\nthe principal axis, towards\\na point P (pole of the mirror),\\non the concave mirror\\n[Fig. 9.6 (a)] or a convex\\nmirror [Fig. 9.6 (b)], is\\nreflected obliquely. The\\nincident and reflected rays\\nfollow the laws of reflection\\n(a) (b)\\nat the point of incidence\\n(point P), making equal FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....66666\\nangles with the principal axis.\\nRemember that in all the above cases the laws of reflection are followed.\\nAt the point of incidence, the incident ray is reflected in such a way that\\nthe angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.\\n(a) Image formation by Concave Mirror\\nFigure 9.7 illustrates the ray diagrams for the formation of image\\nby a concave mirror for various positions of the object.\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 139\\n2024-25FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....77777 Ray diagrams for the image formation by a concave mirror\\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 99999.....44444\\nn Draw neat ray diagrams for each position of the object shown in\\nTable 9.1.\\nn You may take any two of the rays mentioned in the previous section\\nfor locating the image.\\nn Compare your diagram with those given in Fig. 9.7.\\nn Describe the nature, position and relative size of the image formed\\nin each case.\\nn Tabulate the results in a convenient format.\\nUses of concave mirrors\\nConcave mirrors are commonly used in torches, search-lights and\\nvehicles headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light. They are\\noften used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face. The\\ndentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of patients.\\nLarge concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to produce\\nheat in solar furnaces.\\n(b) Image formation by a Convex Mirror\\nWe studied the image formation by a concave mirror. Now we shall\\nstudy the formation of image by a convex mirror.\\n140 Science\\n2024-25AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 99999.....55555\\nn Take a convex mirror.

State whether the image will move\\ncloser to or farther away from the focus as the object is moved\\naway from the mirror?\\nWe consider two positions of the object for studying the image formed\\nby a convex mirror. First is when the object is at infinity and the second\\nposition is when the object is at a finite distance from the mirror. The ray\\ndiagrams for the formation of image by a convex mirror for these two\\npositions of the object are shown in Fig.9.8 (a) and (b), respectively. The\\nresults are summarised in Table 9.2.\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....88888 Formation of image by a convex mirror\\nTable 9.2 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a convex mirror\\nPosition of the Position of the Size of the Nature of the\\nobject image image image\\nAt infinity At the focus F, Highly diminished, Virtual and erect\\nbehind the mirror point-sized\\nBetween infinity Between P and F, Diminished Virtual and erect\\nand the pole P of behind the mirror\\nthe mirror\\nYou have so far studied the image formation by a plane mirror, a\\nconcave mirror and a convex mirror.

One such mirror is fitted in a wall of Agra Fort facing Taj\\nMahal. If you visit the Agra Fort, try to observe the full image of Taj\\nMahal. To view distinctly, you should stand suitably at the terrace\\nadjoining the wall.\\nUses of convex mirrors\\nConvex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors in\\nvehicles. These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the\\ndriver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex\\nmirrors are preferred because they always give an erect, though\\ndiminished, image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved\\noutwards. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger\\narea than would be possible with a plane mirror.\\nQ U E S T I O N S\\n?\\n1. Define the principal focus of a concave mirror.\\n2.

Why do we prefer a convex mirror as a rear-view mirror in vehicles?\\n9.2.3 Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Mirrors\\nWhile dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors, we shall\\nfollow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign\\nConvention. In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the\\norigin (Fig. 9.9). The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis\\n(X’X) of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows –\\n(i) The object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This implies\\nthat the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand\\nside.\\n(ii) All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the\\npole of the mirror.\\n(iii) All the distances measured to the right of the origin (along\\n+ x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of\\nthe origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.\\n(iv) Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis\\n(along + y-axis) are taken as positive.\\n(v) Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis\\n(along –y-axis) are taken as negative.\\n142 Science\\n2024-25The New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated in\\nFig.9.9 for your reference. These sign conventions are applied to obtain\\nthe mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.\\n9.2.4 Mirror Formula and Magnification\\nIn a spherical mirror, the distance of the\\nobject from its pole is called the object\\ndistance (u). The distance of the image from\\nthe pole of the mirror is called the image\\ndistance (v). You already know that the\\ndistance of the principal focus from the pole\\nis called the focal length (f). There is a\\nrelationship between these three quantities\\ngiven by the mirror formula which is\\nexpressed as\\n1 1 1\\n+ = (9.1)\\nv u f\\nThis formula is valid in all situations for all\\nspherical mirrors for all positions of the\\nobject. You must use the New Cartesian Sign FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....99999\\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors\\nConvention while substituting numerical\\nvalues for u, v, f, and R in the mirror formula\\nfor solving problems.\\nMagnification\\nMagnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to\\nwhich the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.\\nIt is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the\\nobject. It is usually represented by the letter m.\\nIf h is the height of the object and h′ is the height of the image, then\\nthe magnification m produced by a spherical mirror is given by\\nHeight of the image (h′)\\nm =\\nHeight of the object (h)\\nh′\\nm = (9.2)\\nh\\nThe magnification m is also related to the object distance (u) and\\nimage distance (v). It can be expressed as:\\nh′ v\\nMagnification (m) = = − (9.3)\\nh u\\nYou may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as\\nthe object is usually placed above the principal axis. The height of the\\nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images. However, it is to be\\ntaken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the\\nmagnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value\\nof the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 143\\n2024-25Example 9.1\\nA convex mirror used for rear-view on an automobile has a radius of\\ncurvature of 3.00 m.

Does it still move along a straight-line path or change its\\ndirection? We shall recall some of our day-to-day experiences.\\nYou might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond\\ncontaining water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab\\nis placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed\\nthrough the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencil\\npartly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displaced\\nat the interface of air and water.

What happens when a light ray is Refraction of light through a rectangular glass slab\\nincident normally to the interface of two\\nmedia? Try and find out.\\nNow you are familiar with the refraction of light. Refraction is due to\\nchange in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to\\nanother. Experiments show that refraction of light occurs according to\\ncertain laws.\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 147\\n2024-25The following are the laws of refraction of light.\\n(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface\\nof two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the\\nsame plane.\\n(ii) The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of\\nrefraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for\\nthe given pair of media. This law is also known as Snell’s law of\\nrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90o)\\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\\nsini\\n= constant (9.4)\\nsinr\\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium\\nwith respect to the first. Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\\nYou have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from\\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1. In air, the speed of\\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a\\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\\ngiven below.\\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\\nshown in Fig.9.11. Let v be the speed of light in medium 1 and v be the\\n1 2\\nspeed of light in medium 2. The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\\nn . This can be expressed in an equation form as\\n21\\nSpeed of light in medium 1 v\\nn = = 1 (9.5)\\n21 Speed of light in medium 2 v\\n2\\nBy the same argument, the refractive index of medium\\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n .It is given\\n12\\nby\\nSpeed of light in medium 2 v\\nn = = 2 (9.6)\\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 99999.....1111111111 12 Speed of light in medium 1 v\\n1\\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2\\nis considered with respect to vacuum. This is called the absolute refractive\\nindex of the medium. It is simply represented as n .

The refractive index of several media is given in Table 9.3. From\\nthe Table you can know that the refractive index of water, n = 1.33.\\nw\\nThis means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of\\nlight in water is equal to 1.33. Similarly, the refractive index of crown\\nglass, n =1.52. Such data are helpful in many places. However, you\\ng\\nneed not memorise the data.\\nTable 9.3 Absolute refractive index of some material media\\nMaterial Refractive Material Refractive\\nmedium index medium index\\nAir 1.0003 Canada 1.53\\nBalsam\\nIce 1.31\\nWater 1.33 Rock salt 1.54\\nAlcohol 1.36\\nKerosene 1.44 Carbon 1.63\\ndisulphide\\nFused 1.46\\nquartz Dense 1.65\\nflint glass\\nTurpentine 1.47\\noil Ruby 1.71\\nBenzene 1.50\\nSapphire 1.77\\nCrown 1.52\\nglass Diamond 2.42\\nNote from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\\ngreater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher refractive\\nindex, is optically denser than water, although its mass density is less\\nthan water.\\nThe ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density.\\nOptical density has a definite connotation. It is not the same as mass density. We have\\nbeen using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually\\nmeans ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can\\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\\none with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other. The other\\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rarer. The speed of light is higher in a rarer\\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\\ndenser medium slows down and bends towards the normal. When it travels from a\\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 149\\n!wonK\\not\\neroM\\n2024-25Q U E S T I O N S\\n1.

The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker\\nare examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We\\nshall discuss these in this section.\\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both\\nsurfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means\\nthat a lens is bound by at least one spherical\\nsurface. In such lenses, the other surface would\\nbe plane. A lens may have two spherical\\nsurfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called\\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are\\n(a)\\nalso called converging lenses. Similarly, a double\\nconcave lens is bounded by two spherical\\nsurfaces, curved inwards. It is thicker at the\\nedges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge\\nlight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses\\nare also called diverging lenses. A double concave\\nlens is simply called a concave lens.\\nA lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,\\n(b) has two spherical surfaces.

Since there are two\\ncentres of curvature, we may represent them as C and C . An imaginary\\n1 2\\nstraight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is\\ncalled its principal axis. The central point of a lens is its optical centre. It is\\n150 Science\\n2024-25usually represented by the letter O. A ray of light through the optical\\ncentre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. The effective\\ndiameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.\\nWe shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose\\naperture is much less than its radius of curvature and the two centres of\\ncurvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are\\ncalled thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays\\nof light are incident on a lens?

Several rays of light parallel to the\\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\\nnow the action of a concave lens.\\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\\naxis.

Magnification is represented by the letter m. If h is the\\nheight of the object and h′ is the height of the image given by a lens, then\\nthe magnification produced by the lens is given by,\\nHeight of the Image h′\\nm = = (9.9)\\nHeight of the object h\\nMagnification produced by a lens is also related to the object-distance\\nu, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given by\\nMagnification (m ) = h′/h = v/u (9.10)\\nExample 9.3\\nA concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should\\nthe object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm\\nfrom the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens.\\nSolution\\nA concave lens always forms a virtual, erect image on the same side\\nof the object.\\nImage-distance v = –10 cm;\\nFocal length f = –15 cm;\\nObject-distance u = ?\\n1 1 1\\nSince − =\\nv u f\\n1 1 1\\nor, = –\\nu v f\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n= – =– +\\nu –10 (–15) 10 15\\n1 −3+2 1\\n= =\\nu 30 −30\\nor, u = – 30 cm\\nThus, the object-distance is 30 cm.\\nMagnification m = v/u\\n−10cm 1\\nm = = ;+0.33\\n−30cm 3\\nThe positive sign shows that the image is erect and virtual. The image\\nis one-third of the size of the object.\\nExample 9.4\\nA 2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a\\nconvex lens of focal length 10 cm. The distance of the object from the\\nlens is 15 cm. Find the nature, position and size of the image. Also\\nfind its magnification.\\n156 Science\\n2024-25Solution\\nHeight of the object h = + 2.0 cm;\\nFocal length f = + 10 cm;\\nobject-distance u = –15 cm;\\nImage-distance v = ?\\nHeight of the image h′ = ?\\n1 1 1\\nSince − =\\nv u f\\n1 1 1\\nor, = +\\nv u f\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n= + =− +\\nv (−15) 10 15 10\\n1 −2+3 1\\n= =\\nv 30 30\\nor, v = + 30 cm\\nThe positive sign of v shows that the image is formed at a distance of\\n30 cm on the other side of the optical centre. The image is real and\\ninverted.\\nh' v\\nMagnification m = =\\nh u\\nor, h′ = h (v/u)\\nHeight of the image, h′ = (2.0) (+30/–15) = – 4.0 cm\\nMagnification m = v/u\\n+30cm\\nor, m= =−2\\n−15cm\\nThe negative signs of m and h′ show that the image is inverted and\\nreal. It is formed below the principal axis. Thus, a real, inverted image,\\n4 cm tall, is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the other side of the\\nlens. The image is two times enlarged.\\n9.3.8 Power of a Lens\\nYou have already learnt that the ability of a lens to converge or diverge\\nlight rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of\\nshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing\\nthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short\\nfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\\nby a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is defined\\nas the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter P. The\\npower P of a lens of focal length f is given by\\n1\\nP = (9.11)\\nf\\nLight – Reflection and Refraction 157\\n2024-25The SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D.\\nIf f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,\\n1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m–1.\\nYou may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a\\nconcave lens is negative.\\nOpticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers. Let us\\nsay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D. This means the lens\\nprescribed is convex. The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,\\na lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m. The lens is concave.\\nMany optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase\\nthe magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power (P) of the lenses placed\\nin contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P , P , P , … as\\n1 2 3\\nP = P + P + P + …\\n1 2 3\\nThe use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.\\nDuring eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses\\nof known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculates\\nthe power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination\\nof two lenses of power + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.\\nThe simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems\\nto minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens. Such a lens system,\\nconsisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses of\\ncamera, microscopes and telescopes.\\nQ U E S T I O N S\\n?\\n1.
